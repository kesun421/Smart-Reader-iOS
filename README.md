### SmartReaderiOS

Smart Reader is an iOS RSS app that uses machine learning to reduce information overload.

Smart Reader does what all standard RSS app does - allows user to follow RSS feeds - but it also applies machine learning algorithms to the news articles, learns what the user like to read, then further suggests articles to read among a sea of news.

### Features

* Performs smoothly on iPhone, targeting baseline of iPhone 5s.

* Uses async and background processing techniques to reduce impact to appâ€™s UI thread.
